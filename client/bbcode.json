BBCODE PARSING FILE

This file defines how the context handles
the parsing of bbcode as displayed to the
end user.

To define a new BBCode entry, create a new
object in the bbcode array that has three
properties: tag, arg, and swap.

Tag is the name of the tag being parsed. For
instance, if you wanted to parse the [url]
tag, you would set the tag property to "url".

Arg is a boolean that determines if the code
in question should expect an argument in the
form of [tagname=arg]. Set this to true if
you want to record this, and false if you
don't expect such an argument.

Swap is the HTML code that the bbcode is
exchanged for. Depending on how you set
the arg property, you will have to deal
with this property differently:
    - If the arg property is set to false,
      the value $1 is replaced with the
      contents inside of the tag; eg. the
      tag pair [b]hello[/b] would store
      hello in $1.
    - If the arg property is set to true,
      the value $1 is replaced with the
      argument specified by the user and
      $2 is the contents inside of the
      tag; eg. the pair [col=blue]hi[/col]
      would store blue in $1 and hi in $2.
