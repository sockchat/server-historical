                      SOCK CHAT PROTOCOL INFORMATION

    Messages communicated between the client and server follow the same fo-
rmat, but have different meanings depending on which end is the recipient.
A message's intent is determined by its packet ID, a unique identifier that
tells the client or server how it should react to the received message. A
message id that incites bidirectional communication between the client and
server should typically be associated with the same message id on the client
as on the server, so as to avoid confusion.

    A packet of communication between the client and server is considered to
be a seamlessly connected regions of octets, the boundaries of which are de-
fined in the header of the packet.

    All binary-encoded multi-byte numbers sent in a packet are to be sent in
network byte order (big endian).
                      
                              --- HEADER ---
                      
    Because the body of the packet is a sequence of many different regions of
octet data that is not delimited, it is necessary for the header of the packet
to determine boundaries for the regions of data.

    The first two bytes are the packet id, the necessary ones of which are de-
fined in the_SERVER_ and _CLIENT_ sections; a two-byte binary number.

    The third byte is the number of octet regions, in the packet.
    
    The bytes following the third byte are a sequence of binary length segments,
each of which correspond to the number of octets in its respective region. They
each follow this format:

        IF LENGTH IS LESS THAN 254, THE LENGTH OF THE REGION IS STORED IN A
    SINGLE BYTE.
        
        IF LENGTH IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 254 BUT LESS THAN 65536, THE
    FIRST BYTE OF THE LENGTH SEGMENT SHOULD BE 254 AND THE FOLLOWING TWO
    BYTES SHOULD BE THE LENGTH OF THE REGION.
    
        IF LENGTH IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 65536, THE FIRST BYTE OF THE
    LENGTH SEGMENT SHOULD BE 255 AND THE FOLLOWING FOUR BYTES SHOULD BE THE
    LENGTH OF THE REGION.
    
    The number of length segments should be equal to the number of octet re-
gions as defined in the third byte.

                               --- BODY ---
                               
    The message body immediately follows the header with no separator, and con-
sists of a sequence of octet regions as defined in the header that are joined
together without any separator. The position of an octet region in the body should
correspond to the offset of the length segment in the header.

                 ---- BASE PROTOCOL SPECIFIC PACKET IDS ----

                              --- SERVER ---                                

0 - User keepalive ping. Done to prevent the client from closing the session
    due to socket inactivity. The only parameter is the user id.
    
1 - User join request. Takes a variable number of parameters that are fed
    into the authentication script associated with the chat.
    
2 - User message. The first parameter is the channel, the second parameter
    is the message.
                              
                              --- CLIENT ---
                              
0 - Keepalive ping response. Not actually handled, but the client does rec-
    eive it. Maybe do something with this later, I dunno. First and only 
    parameter is always the string 'pong'.

1 - User joining message. Sent to incoming connections.
    
    If 'y' (connection accepted), the parameters are as follows:
        - USER ID
        - USER NAME
        - USER COLOR
        - PERMISSION STRING
        - DEFAULT CHANNEL
        - MAX MESSAGE LENGTH
    
    If 'n' (connection refused), the parameters are as follows:
        - REASON ENUMERATION
            - 0: AUTH DATA IS WRONG
            - 1: USERNAME IN USE
            - 2: SOCKET SESSION ALREADY STARTED
            - 3: BANNED
                - followed by unban timestamp
                    - standard unix timestamp, or -1 if permanent
                
2 - Chat message to be parsed. Takes a general form but has a special case
    for bot messages.
    
    - TIMESTAMP
    - USER ID
    - USER NAME
    - USER COLOR
    - PERMISSION STRING
    - MESSAGE (SANITIZED)
    - MESSAGE ID
	- MESSAGE FLAGS [SET OF BOOLEANS ('1'/'0')]
        - BOLD USERNAME
        - ITALICIZED USERNAME
        - UNDERLINED USERNAME
        - COLON AFTER MESSAGE
    - ALERT [BOOLEAN '1'/'0']
    - CHANNEL
    
    If the channel begins with an @, it's a special condition. Two special
    conditions can arise with the channel.
        - IF CHANNEL IS @all, WRITE MESSAGE TO ALL OPEN CHATS
        - IF CHANNEL IS @priv, MESSAGE IS A PRIVATE MESSAGE
        - IF CHANNEL IS @local, WRITE MESSAGE TO ACTIVE CHAT
    
    If the message is sent by the chat bot, the USER ID will be set to -1,
    and the MESSAGE will be a series of strings concatenated by the form
    feed operator, ASCII character 0x0C represented by the escape sequence
    \f. The strings will take the following form:
        - MESSAGE TYPE ENUMERATION
            - 0 if normal message
            - 1 if error message
        - LANG FILE ID STRING
        - PARAMETERS
            - the additional parameters as fed into the lang string
            
3 - Informs clients (usually in same channel) that data on a specific user 
    has been changed. Used for things like changing nicknames or temporary
    privilege elevation.
    
    The first argument is the user ID of the affected user (which can never
    change). Following are the details of the user:
    
        - USER NAME
        - USER COLOR
        - PERMISSION STRING

4 - Channel creation/deletion/update notification to clients. First parame-
    ter is either a 0, a 1 or a 2, 0 indicating creation, 1 indicating del-
    etion, and 2 indicating an update.
    
    If 0, the parameters are as follows:
        - CHANNEL NAME
        - IS PASSWORD PROTECTED (bool, 1 or 0)
        - IS TEMPORARY (bool, 1 or 0)
        
    If 1, the parameters are as follows:
        - CHANNEL NAME
        
    If 2, the parameters are as follows:
        - OLD CHANNEL NAME
        - NEW CHANNEL NAME
        - IS PASSWORD PROTECTED (bool, 1 or 0)
        - IS TEMPORARY (bool, 1 or 0)
    
5 - User changing channel information for clients. First parameter is 0 or 
    1 to indicate whether the user is joining or leaving, the following pa-
    rameters depend on the first:
        
        If 0, the parameters are as follows:
            - CHANNEL NAME
        And indicates the current channel a user has joined.
        
        If 1, the parameters are as follows:
            - CHANNEL NAME
        And indicates the current channel a user has left.
        
6 - Indicates deletion of specific context data. The first parameter is
    either a 0 or 1 to enumerate what is to be deleted. The following par-
    ameters depend on the first:
    
        If 0, the following parameter is a message id, and represents a
        message to be deleted.
        
        If 1, the parameters are as follows:
            - USER ID
            - CHANNEL NAME
                - If @all, remove user from all channels.
        And indicates a user being dropped from a channel context.
    
7 - Indicates the sending of miscellaneous data to clients for context inf-
    ormation. First parameter is 0, 1, or 2 to indicate whether the data is
    a chat message, a user, or a channel. The following parameters depend
    on the first:
    
        If 0, the parameters are as follows:
            - CHANNEL NAME USERS BELONG TO
            - A COUNT OF USERS SENT IN PACKET (represented as N)
            - N REPETITIONS OF
                - USER ID
                - USER NAME
                - USER COLOR
                - PERMISSION STRING
              WHICH EACH REPRESENT A SINGLE USER
            
        If 1, the parameters are as follows:
            - A COUNT OF CHANNELS SENT IN PACKET (represented as N)
            - N REPETITIONS OF
                - CHANNEL NAME
                - IS PASSWORD PROTECTED (bool, 1 or 0)
                - IS TEMPORARY (bool, 1 or 0)
              WHICH EACH REPRESENT A SINGLE CHANNEL
              
8 - Forces the client to clear a specific portion of the context. First pa-
    rameter is an integer from 0 to 4 to indicate what should be cleared.
    
        0 represents clearing the message list.
        1 represents clearing the user list.
        2 represents clearing the channel list.
        3 represents clearing both the message and user list.
        4 represents clearing all three lists.
        
        If first parameter is anything other than 2, then 
        
9 - Tells a client that they are about to have their socket session forcef-
    ully terminated. Used to indicate either a kick or a ban.
    
    First argument is a 0, representing a kick, or a 1, representing a ban.
    If the first argument is 1, then the following argument is a length sp-
    ecifier for the ban duration in unix epoch time.
